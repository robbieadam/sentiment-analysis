C3 Hotel Ungaran,chrno cruz,4.0,"my first visit was around 8 to 9 years ago, and nothing really change in terms of room quality. it's clean, neat, have a good air circulation even though it doesn't have a window (for twin bed rooms). but for sure, it's more pricey in 2022 than from my first visit...still reasonable though. what i like, there's a bar-service (meal order to the room), spacey parking lot, and good service. i'm not a demanding person....so when my room is clean, neat, and dry with all the feature working just fine, then it's all good for me. but when talk about elderly....this hotel isn't senior-friendly...not quite...there's no elevator/lift which may become quite a problem from senior guest who has health issues for reach even the second floor (up to third floor). still...C3 hotel will be my first alternative to stay, for i know for sure, i will have a comfy and nice rest here and if i has enough in my wallet...heheh..."

And again this is little notable for me since I have to stay here for mor than 4 days, so my luggage is quite heavy..Luckily my room is in the second floor. So do for the ballroom, the ballroom we use to have training is in the 2nd floor, and there is no toilet upstairs, so we need to go downstairs to go to the restroom.. The food is fine...and the snacks as well.. I love the artistic of putting the inspiration and positive quote along the corridor wall.."

C3 Hotel Ungaran,Nurul Auliani,5.0,"(Translated by Google) The hotel is clean, tidy, hand sanitizer is provided in each room near the door. We ordered 2 family rooms that are next to each other, the room size is still spacious, comfortable for a family with many children, but we have to be careful if the child is still small3 because there is a bunk bed (level bed). Park our car in front of the room, so it's very easy. Breakfast tastes good, although the menu choices are less varied. The location is on the edge of a major road, across from Sate Pak Kempleng 1, beside/a row of hotels there is also Domino's Pizza & KFC, so it's safe if you are looking for children's food (Original) Hotelnya bersih, rapi, disediakan hand sanitizer di dalam tiap kamar dkt pintu. Kami memesan 2 family room yg bersebelahan, ukuran kamar masih lega, nyaman utk yg keluarga dgn banyak anak, tapi harus hati2 jika anak msh kecil3 krn ada bunk bed (tempat tidur tingkat). Parkir mobil kami di depan kamar, jd sgt memudahkan. Sarapan pagi rasanya enak, walau pilihan menu kurang variasi. Lokasi di pinggir jalan besar, sebrang Sate Pak Kempleng 1, di samping/deretan hotel juga ada Domino's Pizza & KFC, jd aman kalau cari makanan anak2üòÅ"
C3 Hotel Ungaran,yudhi andrey,1.0,"(Translated by Google) I stayed here for 5 days due to a business trip. And very bad service here. 1. The first day I checked in on October 24, I was not allowed to enter before paying at least 50%. Even though this hotel already has a partnership with my company. 2. I stayed in room 214, in that room: the air conditioner leaked and was not repaired until the last day 3. On the 26th at 08.00 I made payment for this hotel and asked for a receipt, but the receptionist was not given the reason I had not checked out. Even though normally, if people have paid in full, it's just a matter of giving them a receipt. 4. On the 27th, the towels given were very dirty and there was no tissue in my room. Very disappointing to stay at a hotel like this. (Original) Saya nginap disini selama 5 hari karena perjalanan dinas. Dan sangat buruk pelayanan disini. 1. Hari pertama saya check in tanggal 24 oktober, saya tidak boleh masuk sebelum membayar minimal 50%. Padahal hotel ini sudah ada kerjasama dengan perusahaan saya. 2. Saya menginap di kamar 214, dalam kamar tersebut : AC bocor dan tidak dibenerin sampai hari terakhir 3. Di tanggal 26 jam 08.00 saya melakukan pelunasan atas hotel ini dan minta kwitansi, namun sama resepsionist tidak diberikan dengan alasan saya belum check out. Padahal normalnya, kalau orang udah bayar penuh, yaaa tinggal kasih dunk kwitansi. 4. Di tanggal 27, handuk yang diberikan sangat kotor serta tidak ada tisu dalam kamar saya. Sangat mengecewakan bermalam di hotel seperti ini."
C3 Hotel Ungaran,ferry tjen,5.0,"(Translated by Google) It's really ok to stop by and move around the tourist area here. For family rooms, up to 4 beds. The bathroom water is runny and clean, suggestions for the bathroom floor can be found a way not to be slippery (although it dries quickly) for parents to be a little careful so as not to slip.. Oh yes, for breakfast, the menu and taste are quite ok. (Original) Ok banget utk mampir dan bergerak di area wisata sini. Utk kamar keluarga bisa sampai 4 kasur. Kamar mandi airnya kuenceng dan bersih, saran utk lantai kamar mandi bisa dicari cara utk tidak licin (meskipun cepat kering) utk orang tua rada harus hati-hati supaya tidak terpeleset.. Oh ya utk sarapan cukup ok menu dan rasanya."
C3 Hotel Ungaran,Nurul Rahma,5.0,"(Translated by Google) Hotel rooms for families are very comfortable with bunk beds. Besides being clean and beautiful, this hotel is cool even though it is located on the edge of the highway. Maybe it would be better if there was a bigger hotel sign, so that car drivers wouldn't go too far. (Original) Kamar hotel untuk family sangat nyaman dengan kasur tingkat. Selain bersih dan asri, hotel ini sejuk walau terletak di pinggir jalan raya. Mungkin akan lebih baik jika ada plang hotel yg lebih besar, agar pengendara mobil tidak kebablasan."

Middle school finally checked out at 9 pm and other lodgings because it was too commercial. Maybe we exceeded the capacity, when we wanted to pay extra, it turned out to be 150k per person without any facilities. extra bed added again. Want to plug in the keyboard, add 500 thousand. Ok, well, finally, some of us want to go out and we have time to gather and we are given time to junior high school at 8 pm wkwkkwk. The reason is the babinsa rules, but for example, we wanted to pay extra, it's okay, the babinsa. Thank God, we got another inn that could fit everyone with a wider and more comfortable place. kt g just want to stay at the hotel of our home people too, really. cm there is a gathering place and this position is a lot of old people and children, babies. We will not be staying there again and will not recommend it to other people. (Original) awalnya masuk oke tmptnya sejuk tapi ternyata bikin ribet keluarga kami. Smp akhirnya cekout jam 9 an mlm dan cr penginapan lain krn terlalu komersil.

Ok yaudah akhirnya mau kluar sebagian kita mnt waktu buat kumpul dan dikasi waktu smp jm 8 mlm wkwkkwwk. alasanya aturan babinsa tp misal kita tadi mau bayar tmbahan ga apa2 ya babinsa nya.Alhamdulillah dpt penginapan lain yg bs muat semua org dg tmpt yg lebih luas dan nyaman. kt g semata2 pgn nginep hotel org rmh kita jg dkt2 kok. cm pgn tmpt ngumpul dan ini posisinya byk org sepuh sepuh dan anak , bayi.

The service is friendly and pretty clean, although it seems like it hasn't been crowded for a long time during the pandemic, but he said now there have been a lot of guests.

Hotel Serrata,Fajar Satria,4.0,"Shadow of it's former past. compared to early 2000's, there's almost no improvement, only decline in quality. perhaps the pandemic hit them hard, let's hope that they can return to their former glory."
Hotel Serrata,Kanthy Zukhrifah,1.0,"I was spending the nights here for two days with my family. In the first day, the service was good. From the receptionist till the employees who accompanied us to the room, they cooperated well. Yet, the problem occured in my second day of staying. THE BREAKFAST SERVICE WAS TERRIBLE. How did they treat us like strangers yet we're visitors there in fact? Here, you'll be given kind of coupon to exchange it with breakfast. It was written that the breakfast time would be available from 6-10 am. When I went to the pantry at 8.30, the food was almost run out. I was waiting for about 30 minutes till I decided to talk to the receptionist. She told me she had called other employee to serve us. But, the employee just never showed up. I was going back and forth to the receptionist table for just making sure that I and my sisters got our food. And finally, one employee came and I directly asked him to cook us some omelette. That's it. My breakfast was just a plate of white rice and an omelette. There was no much food left. I had no energy anymore to scold her for refilling the other food. Almost 5/6 times, I was ranting at her. What a great breakfast to start a day! Fyi, there was a wedding held in the main hall (front room) when this tragedy happened. And you know what? The receptionist told me that there are no employees around due to that wedding event. Shortly, she tried to ask for my understanding for not being able to treat us good enough because of the wedding. Such a shame. How poor their services are! I know, mayhap some of you might be wondering why I'm creating such a ruckus for the mere thing,breakfast. No, Honey. IT IS A MAJOR THING. It is a hotel. Their jobs to deliver good services is needed. What would you expect but good services while staying at a hotel? We dont want our money wasted, right? I had visited many hotels from the cheapest to the most expensive, or from the simple one to the luxury ones. This was the worst. Buat yang tidak bisa bahasa Inggris, perhatikan omongan saya. Pokoknya, hotel ini tidak recommended. Cari saja hotel lain. Kalau ingin tetap ke sini, silahkan. Semoga saja mereka sudah berubah lebih baik."

Hotel Serrata,JesS iCa,2.0,"(Translated by Google) The food is actually Lynyn ok and there is a swimming pool. But if the service is not ok, the manager and receptionist are very uncooperative and confusing, too rigid and unpleasant. When used for parties, the dinner plate is still there, the food is gone. Like reduced portions. When I want to add it or not, I can't and it says there's no ingredients. The decoration of the package is not good enough, entertainment and sound are good. The standard room is very old fashioned. (Original) Makannya sebenarnya lmyn ok dan ada kolam renang. Tapiiii pelayanannya kurang ok, managernya dan resepsionis sangat ga kooperatif dan membingungkan, terlalu kaku dan tidak menyenangkan. Saat digunakan unt pesta, masa piring makan masih ada, makanan sudah habis. Seperti dikurangi porsinya. Saat mau nambah blg ga bisa dan dilama2in bilangnya ga ada bahan. Dekorasi yg paket seadanya kurang bagus, entertain dan sound lmyn bagus. Kamar standar, sudah kuno sekali."
